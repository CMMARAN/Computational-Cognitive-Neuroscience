# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience
For this course we implement several neural networks using [Chainer](https://chainer.org/).

The structure is as follows:
* Practical Assignment 1: MNIST using a MLP
* Practical Assignment 2: MNIST using a CNN
* Practical Assignment 3: Train a RNN to add numbers
* Practical Assignment 4: Classifying MNIST using Ridge and Bayesian Regression
* Practical Assignment 5: Q-learning using DNNs
* Practical Assignment 6: Creating MNIST images using GANs
* Final Project: Implement Deep Q-learning in the Atari-py environment.
